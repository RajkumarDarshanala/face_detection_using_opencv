# face_detection_using_opencv
this project is to detect faces in an image or in  live stream from camera


This code is an implimented code in spyder(python 3.6)
and there will be no errors so if some thing is not working then there must be a problem in required packages to be installed.

the two file 
haarcascade_eye.xml
haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml
are the required to paste in the directory of the present console where the code is running

They are taken to train the model to identify faces and eyes respectively

if the code is not working then you can contact me through the mail rkraj1452@gmail.com

Thank you
